                    MLT continues “GIVING THANKS” to our Business Memberships by
                    thanking the support of one of our newest Business Members,
                    Caroline Bartlett.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Caroline is a Visual Art Teacher at Cannon County Schools
                    and the mother of very talented young actor, Charlie. You
                    may have seen Charlie, as Wilbur, in CFTA’s recent
                    production of “Charlotte’s Web” or as Randy in ACCC’s
                    production of “A Christmas Story” or you may have seen him
                    with MLT in “Fun Home” and “Tales from Neverland”. So, it is
                    not surprising that Caroline’s message is “Children Need
                    Art.” Here at MLT we 100% agree with Caroline and have
                    created youth opportunities with our virtual Christmas
                    production and are preparing for a future production of
                    “Junie B is not a Crook” as well as summer camps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We hope to have both Caroline and Charlie back with MLT soon
                    and we thank them for their talents and their continued
                    support.

                    Chris Quarto (and the whole Quarto family – Kathy, Luke and
                    Michelle) became involved with MLT back in 2006, and he and
                    wife Kathy have been faithful supporters ever since. In
                    fact, Chris was the original designer and webmaster for our
                    MLTArts.com site. Chris specializes in providing services
                    for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and has worked
                    with children, adolescents and adult suffering from anxiety,
                    depression and relationship issues. Most recently, Dr.
                    Quarto created a podcast series for graduate students and
                    the general public called "Make a Mental Note" (<a
                      href="https://rb.gy/md1mwf"

                      >https://rb.gy/md1mwf</a
                    >) in which he interviewed mental health professionals on
                    topics such as trauma, addiction and women's issues. In this
                    world, we can all use someone understanding and objective,
                    and Dr. Chris fits the bill! He has always been there for
                    MLT!

                    MLT continues “GIVING THANKS” to our Business Memberships
                    this week by featuring musical director, teacher and
                    songbird, Kathy Quarto.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like her husband Chris, Kathy became involved with MLT back
                    in 2006 - and has been a strong presence on and off the
                    stage. If you are a fan of MLT musicals, you will recognize
                    her lovely face, and remember her lovely voice, in “High
                    Society”, “Working”, “The 1940's Radio Hour”, “Chess” and
                    most recently as Mdme Dubonnet in “The Boy Friend”. Behind
                    the MLT scenes, she has served as Secretary on the Board of
                    Directors, as well as bring the proud mom of Luke and
                    Michelle (who have also performed on the MLT stage on number
                    occasions). Kathy adores playing the drums and is band
                    director at Rockvale Middle School, and is deeply committed
                    to her church, Saint Henry Catholic Church in Nashville -
                    where, you guessed it - she sings and plays the drums! In
                    her spare time, Kathy is YOUR local Mary Kay Cosmetics
                    representative, and is always happy to share beauty tips,
                    offer free samples, lead a virtual party or a party with
                    friends, or tailor a consultation just for you. As we often
                    joke, “Dr. Chris will fix your head, Ms. Kathy will fix your
                    face”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thanks to the entire Quarto Family for their many years of
                    ongoing support of MLT.

                    MLT kicks off “GIVING THANKS” for our Business Memberships
                    by highlighting the Middle Tennessee Association of
                    REALTORS, better know as MTAR!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes, MTAR has been supporting MLT longer than any business
                    member we have – and not just thru an annual membership, but
                    in countless other ways. MTAR has been a resource that MLT
                    has depended on since 2000, ever since Candy Joyce, the
                    Association’s Executive, auditioned for a role in “Mame”.
                    After kicking up her heels and singing her heart out, Candy
                    has been heavily involved ever since. From her performances
                    In “Cotton Patch Gospel” and “Some Enchanted Evening” to the
                    recent radio production “Sorry, Wrong Number”, her REALTORS
                    have backed her support of the arts. Whether she was getting
                    REALTORS involved in productions, providing rehearsal space,
                    serving as MLT President, or representing MLT to the City,
                    Candy and MTAR have proven to be one of MLT’s greatest
                    assets!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To Candy and the almost 2,300 MTAR REALTORS that make a
                    difference in our community in so many ways, we humbly thank
                    you for your support!
