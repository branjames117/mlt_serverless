            <p class="text-left mt-8">It's the day of Granddaddy's funeral, and no one has showed up. Rebecca is distraught about her Daddy dying. Caroline and Kathryn are apathetic, spiteful and full of smart-aleck remarks. Caroline is hateful and Kathryn is more interested in getting to a dance later that evening. Evan arrives late with his boyfriend Marshall (who Kathryn keeps hitting on). Evan seems only interested in drinking and leaving especially after insensitive and racist remarks from his Aunt Rebecca about Marshall and their relationship. Brother George is kindly confused about all the drama and frequently falling asleep. Amidst the fighting, the lack of mourners, the botched eulogy, they try to carry the casket out only for the unthinkable to happen. This adds to the hysterics, which culminate in revelations of family secrets, clearing of misunderstandings, and a final understanding of why no one showed up for the funeral.</p>
